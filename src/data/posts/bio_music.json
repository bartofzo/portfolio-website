I started my studies at the conservatory of Tilburg and switched to the conservatory of Amsterdam where I graduated with honours in 2012."

            "text" : "After studying jazz intensively, I wanted to explore sounds that six strings can’t produce. I started experimenting with electronic music, using computers and synthesizers to create sounds. From this, the alias ‘Brad Coleman’ emerged as an outlet for all of my electronic endeavours. I started mainly focusing on dance music, but as time passed, so did the boundaries. Diving into producing electronic music has shaped me to become a better musician. It made me more conscious about sound and the role every musical element has in a piece."
